# MvImport Vendor Bindings

This directory contains the auto-generated ctypes bindings provided with the
Hikvision/MVS camera SDK. The files (`*_header.py`, `*_const.py`, and
`MvCameraControl_class.py`) are produced by the vendor's tools and should be
treated as third-party assets. Avoid manual edits unless you regenerate the
bindings from the upstream XML definitions, as local changes will be lost on
the next import update.
